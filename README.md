**a. How long the assessment took you in man hours?**

This project required approximately 15 hours of focused coding, encompassing planning, development, debugging, and testing.

**b. List any functionality you were not able to complete or known issues within the code you were not able to resolve?**

Due to limitations with the beta Toolpad UI framework, I was unable to customize the `AccountPreview` component to exclude the email display. The framework's default behavior includes the email, and I couldn't find sufficient documentation to override or replace it within the given timeframe. This impacted the initial display of the user's account information, as I aimed to show only the name and avatar. Additionally, in the "Newest Practices" table, I utilized the MUI XDataGrid component, which includes built-in pagination. I was unable to customize it to replace the pagination with a "Show More" clickable text link for loading additional data. Furthermore, finding specific icons that perfectly matched the design requirements proved challenging, and I used the closest available icons within the MUI library.

**c. What parts of the test were most challenging to you?**

The primary challenges were:

* **Time Management:** Effectively balancing the project's scope with the limited time available required careful prioritization and decision-making.
* **Toolpad Component Customization:** The beta nature of the Toolpad UI framework made customizing certain components, like `AccountPreview`, difficult due to limited documentation and unexpected behaviors.
* **MUI XDataGrid Customization:** Overriding the default pagination behaviour of the MUI XDataGrid component was also challenging within the given time.
* **Icon Selection:** Locating specific icons that precisely matched the design specifications was difficult, requiring me to use the closest available alternatives.
